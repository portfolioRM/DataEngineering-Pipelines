# Data Engineering and Pipelines Sample
![RM Slide Pic](https://github.com/portfolioRM/DataEngineering-Pipelines/assets/164821000/36e8d4d9-45d2-46b8-921e-93e800c57847)

## Project Summary:
As part of my current work, I engineer data pipelines to integrate external data providing accessibility within the enterprise data warehouse (EDW). I also create data pipelines within the EDW to transform data for visualization and analysis. The files attached show a sample of one pipeline that uses Python to extract specific data from flat-files. This script is written in an object-oriented style. There is also a sample of a SQL pipeline where I pull and aggregate encounter level data to monthly and fiscal year figures across several measures and from different sources.

## Files Uploaded:
1.	*"RashmiMariyappa_1_Pipeline_External Data"*<br>
This is the Python script, written in an object-oriented style, that extracts specific data from flat-files and uploads it into an EDW.<br><br>
2.	*"RashmiMariyappa_2_Pipeline_KPIPresentation"*<br>
This is an excerpt of a presentation I put together for my team on a complex back-end data pipeline that I re-engineered.<br><br>
3.	*"RashmiMariyappa_3_Pipeline_SQLSamples"*<br>
This is a small sample of SQL work of mine. This last entry is one (of many) views in the KPI pipeline in the presentation in this repository. There are also 2 other sample SQL queries.<br><br>
